# MeshAdv Mini

The MeshAdv Mini is a Raspberry Pi hat designed to be used with the Linux-native version of Meshtastic known as meshtasticd. The board includes a +22dbm LoRa module, integrated GPS module, HAT+ EEPROM, Temperature Sensor, 5V PWM Fan header, and breakout for I2C bus including two Qwiic connectors. 
This makes for a good "base station" or "Router" node that can be mounted high on a pole and powered over POE (using separate POE adapter or Hat). No more need to retrieve the node everytime you want to update firmware, it can all be done remotely. It also makes it easy and reliable to connect to MQTT.

# Temp Sensor TMP102

The MeshAdv Mini has an onboard Texas Instruments TMP102 temp sensor soldered in the center of the board near the EEPROM to get a general idea of board/enclosure temperature with 0.5¬∞C accuracy. This sensor uses I2C address 48.

  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Click to Show Instructions</summary>


---


## Step 1: Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi
1. Open the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
2. Go to **"Interface Options" > "I2C"**, enable it, and exit.
3. Reboot the Pi to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

---

## Step 2: Install Required Packages
Update your package list and install **I2C tools** and **Python SMBus**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install i2c-tools python3-smbus -y
```

---

## Step 3: Verify the TMP102 Connection
Find the **I2C address** of the TMP102 sensor:
```bash
sudo i2cdetect -y 1
```
- If connected correctly, you should see **0x48** (default address).

---

## Step 4: Create the Python Script
1. Open a new script file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano tmp102.py
   ```

2. Paste the following Python code:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   import smbus
   import time

   # I2C setup
   bus = smbus.SMBus(1)  # Use I2C bus 1
   TMP102_ADDR = 0x48  # Default I2C address for TMP102

   def read_temp():
       """Reads temperature from TMP102 and converts it to Celsius"""
       raw = bus.read_word_data(TMP102_ADDR, 0)
       
       # Swap byte order (TMP102 stores in little-endian)
       raw = ((raw << 8) & 0xFF00) + (raw >> 8)
       
       # Convert to temperature (TMP102 uses 12-bit resolution)
       temp_c = (raw >> 4) * 0.0625
       return temp_c

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       while True:
           print(f"Temperature: {read_temp():.2f}¬∞C")
           time.sleep(1)
   ```

3. Save and exit (`CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

---

## Step 5: Make the Script Executable
Run this command to **make the script executable**:
```bash
sudo chmod +x tmp102.py
```

---

## Step 6: Run the Script
Now, you can run the script in **three ways**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Using Python**:
   ```bash
   python3 tmp102.py
   ```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Directly from CLI** (since we added a shebang and made it executable):
   ```bash
   ./tmp102.py
   ```


---

## ‚úÖ You're All Set!
Now your **Raspberry Pi** reads temperature from the **TMP102 sensor** and prints it to the console! üéâ

# PWM Fan

The onboard PWM fan connector can support 2 wire 5V fans (Always on), and 4-pin PWM (Tach not implimented). I recommend the [Noctua NF-A4x10 5V PWM 40mm](https://a.co/d/4vufchq) 0r [Noctua NF-A8 5V PWM 80mm](https://a.co/d/56CNeq1)

|Pin|Name    |Color |
|---|--------|------|
|1  |Ground  |Black |
|2  |5V      |Yellow|
|3  |Tach(NA)|Green |
|4  |PWM     |Blue  |

## Option 1: (Easiest - Works with Pi 4 and 5 only) Use the built-in fan control tool to turn fan on and off

1. Open the raspi-config tool by running the following:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
2. Navigate to the "Performance Options" section.
3. Select "Fan" and enable the fan control.
4. Set the GPIO pin to 18 and temperature threshold for the fan to start. By default, the fan starts at 60¬∞C, but you can modify this by editing the /boot/firmware/config.txt file manually.
   ```bash
   sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
   ```
   add the following:
   ```bash
   dtoverlay=gpio-fan,gpiopin=18,temp=60000
   ```
6. Exit and reboot

   ---

## Option 2 (works for most Pi models)

1. Install the Rpi.GPIO Python library
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio
   ```
2. Create a new file called fan_control.py
   ```bash
   sudo nano fan_control.py
   ```
3. Copy the following and save the file:
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   import time

   # Configuration
   FAN_PIN = 18
   TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW = 45.0  # Temperature (¬∞C) at which fan runs at minimum speed
   TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH = 60.0  # Temperature (¬∞C) at which fan runs at max speed

   # Initialize GPIO
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(FAN_PIN, GPIO.OUT)
   pwm = GPIO.PWM(FAN_PIN, 25000)  # 25 kHz PWM frequency
   pwm.start(0)  # Start with fan off

   def get_cpu_temp():
       """Reads the CPU temperature."""
       with open("/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp", "r") as f:
           return int(f.read()) / 1000  # Convert from millidegrees to degrees

   def set_fan_speed(temp):
       """Adjusts fan speed based on temperature."""
       if temp < TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW:
           duty_cycle = 0  # Fan off
       elif temp > TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH:
           duty_cycle = 100  # Full speed
       else:
           # Scale between min and max speed
           duty_cycle = (temp - TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW) / (TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH - TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW) * 100
       pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(duty_cycle)

   try:
       while True:
           temp = get_cpu_temp()
           set_fan_speed(temp)
           print(f"CPU Temp: {temp:.1f}¬∞C | Fan Speed: {int(pwm.ChangeDutyCycle)}%")
           time.sleep(5)  # Check every 5 seconds
   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       print("Fan control stopped")
       pwm.stop()
       GPIO.cleanup()
   ```
4. Make the file executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x fan_control.py
   ```
5. Optional: Run script at boot
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   Add this line at the end:
   ```bash
   @reboot /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/fan_control.py &
   ```
   Hint: use pwd command to find your current directory. Change "/path/to" the location of your script.
